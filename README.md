# Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

In this [Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb](Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb), I use KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. It showcases essential data science and machine learning techniques, offering practical insights into customer segmentation.

## Key Concepts

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Engineering** (_Derived new features_)
3. **Data Transformation** (_Scaling numerical features and one-hot encoding categorical features_)
4. **KMeans Clustering** (_To identifying customer segments_)
5. **Visualization**

## Libraries Used

`pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## Highlights

- **Data Science Fundamentals:** Data handling, exploration, and feature engineering
- **Machine Learning:** KMeans clustering for customer segmentation
- **Data Visualization Techniques:** Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations

## By segmenting customers, we can:

- **Tailor Marketing Campaigns:** Target specific segments with relevant messaging and offers
- **Improve Customer Experience:** Provide personalized recommendations and promotions
- **Increase Customer Lifetime Value:** Retain high-value customers with targeted strategies
