# Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

In this [Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb](Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb), I use KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. It showcases essential data science and machine learning techniques, offering practical insights into customer segmentation.

## Key Concepts

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Engineering** (_Derived new features_)
3. **Data Transformation** (_Scaling numerical features and one-hot encoding categorical features_)
4. **KMeans Clustering** (_Elbow Method to identify optimal clusters_)
5. **Visualization**

## Libraries Used

`pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## Highlights

- **Data Science Fundamentals**: Data handling, exploration, and feature engineering.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Date conversions, **Outlier Handling** using the Interquartile Range, and transforming features with **OneHotEncoder** and StandardScaler.
- **Machine Learning**: Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation with **KMeans**.
- **Data Visualization Techniques**: Created visualizations and insights into cluster characteristics.

## By segmenting customers, we can:

- **Tailor Marketing Campaigns:** Target specific segments with relevant messaging and offers
- **Improve Customer Experience:** Provide personalized recommendations and promotions
- **Increase Customer Lifetime Value:** Retain high-value customers with targeted strategies
